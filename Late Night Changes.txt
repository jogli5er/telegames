# Late Night Changes

- Add userid to GET game/move
- GET game/move/user/{id} returns only moves if the user is in the current team. "moves" is an  
  empty array otherwise
- Error message when POST to game/move/user/{id} when it's not the users turn
- New endpoint statistics/selectedOptions. 0 to 6 are selectable options, 7 are undecided users.
  Example: 

    {
	"0": 0,
	    "1": 0,
	    "2": 0,
	    "3": 1,
	    "4": 0,
	    "5": 0,
	    "6": 0,
	    "7": 7,
	    "turnUserCount": 8,
	    "userCount": 17,
	    "currentMoveTTL": -1560
    }


- Add winnerTeam property. Default value is -1. Changes to the winner team when the isFinished property
  is set to true


TODO: 

- FindCurrentGame should return "old game" longer to show results
